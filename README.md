# detect_in_all_images
Face detection in all images in a folder
Disclaimer: This is for educational purposes only. This is my first try at face detection using a tutorial from https://www.pyimagesearch.com.

Just run the detect_in_all_images.py file and it will detect faces in /images folder. You should create it, if not it will create it for you on the first run.
